For some time now I\textquotesingle{}ve wanted a really powerful database abstraction class. My first stab at this grew from my first ever P\+HP project and is called F\+X.\+php. However, being my first P\+HP project, it\textquotesingle{}s not really as well designed as it could be -- it could be both more streamlined and easier to use.

Rather than trying to cram all of my learning into that project, my thought was to create something new. Enter db$\vert$.php (read as \char`\"{}\+D B pipe dot P H P\char`\"{}). The name feels so perfect, I was surprised that no one seemed to have used it. On the other hand, it is somewhat ostentatious, so maybe others just have better sense.

After mucking around a bit, the syntax I\textquotesingle{}ve come up with looks something like this\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{<?php}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// A couple notes:}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// -\/ The FMX namespace indicates a FileMaker XML datasource}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// -\/ The .ini file would contain the settings for your data sources}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$query = \textcolor{keyword}{new} \mbox{\hyperlink{class_d_b_1_1_f_m_x_1_1_query}{DB\(\backslash\)FMX\(\backslash\)Query}}(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"db\_config.ini"});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$query-\/>where(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"size"})-\/>equalTo(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"large"});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$query-\/>where(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"color"})-\/>notEqualTo(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"red"});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$results = \$query-\/>execute();}
\end{DoxyCode}
 Beautiful, no?

Some features of db$\vert$.php worth noting\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The goal is true abstraction. (i.\+e. no special syntax for different data sources.)
\item {\ttfamily .ini} files can be used for settings (P\+HP has some very powerful associated functionality.)
\item Query syntax makes sense without prior knowledge of the class.
\item In P\+HP arrays have some very powerful, object-\/like behavior; so that\textquotesingle{}s leveraged where it makes sense.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Initial thoughts on data sources to support\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily P\+GS} -\/ Postgre\+S\+QL (this should also give us Cockroach\+DB for free)
\item {\ttfamily F\+MD} -\/ File\+Maker Data A\+PI
\item {\ttfamily F\+MX} -\/ File\+Maker X\+ML
\item {\ttfamily M\+YS} -\/ My\+S\+QL
\item {\ttfamily E\+LS} -\/ Elasticsearch
\item {\ttfamily R\+ED} -\/ Redis
\item {\ttfamily O\+DB} -\/ O\+D\+BC
\item {\ttfamily D\+DR} -\/ File\+Maker Data Design Report (X\+ML syntax)
\item {\ttfamily P\+GN} -\/ Postgre\+S\+QL native libpq
\end{DoxyItemize}

Now to make it work... Heh!
